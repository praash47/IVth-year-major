# IVth year major
This project is not just our college project. This project dedicated for future will be our emotion.

Anticipated to be grand, full of positive emotions to contribute in the name of computer science, in the name of our country, to make the world; a better place to live in is expected in this project. 

This project is to be with full of dedications, selfless contributions and hard work! Not caring about time, nor ourselves, we have to give our 100, no 120% efforts for this and make something valuable out of it. Not to satisfy anyone, not to show anyone, not to express anything to anyone, this project should consist efforts the best.
